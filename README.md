# Adaptive Tamaraw

This repository contains the official implementation of **Adaptive Tamaraw**, a traffic pattern-aware defense mechanism against website fingerprinting (WF) attacks.

Adaptive Tamaraw extends the original Tamaraw defense by dynamically clustering website traffic patterns and applying tailored padding strategies to each cluster, rather than relying on a single global configuration. This approach reduces bandwidth and time overheads while preserving formal privacy guarantees.
